          <p>Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a
            Rosario-based top-division football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious
            clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began
            playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly
            graduated through the higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona
            in
            a friendly match.In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer
            in
            the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres)
            tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally
            left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily
            thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with
            mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. The next year Messi and Barcelona won the
            Champions League (the European club championship) title.

            Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant
            players
            in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon
            d’Or. In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s
            first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga
            championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. He scored 38
            goals in 51 matches during that season, and he bested Ronaldo in the balloting for both the Ballon d’Or and
            FIFA’s world player of the year by a record margin. During the 2009–10 season Messi scored 34 goals in
            domestic games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s
            leading
            scorer, and he received another Ballon d’Or (the award was known as the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010–15).

            Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles the following season, which helped him capture an
            unprecedented third consecutive world player of the year award. In March 2012 he netted his 233rd goal for
            Barcelona, becoming the club’s all-time leading scorer in La Liga play when only 24 years old. He finished
            Barcelona’s 2011–12 season (which included another Copa del Rey win) with 73 goals in all competitions,
            breaking Gerd Müller’s 39-year-old record for single-season goals in a major European football league.</p>
